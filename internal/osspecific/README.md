### OS Specific functions

This directory keeps some base packages that are too OS specific to be included in the main codebase.

All packages here must implement non-error alternatives and be able to compile on all OS.

TODO:
- [ ] aAll packages must implement special build flag for building the project entirely without OS specific functions.
