This project brings fully functioning [XRay](https://github.com/XTLS/Xray-core) VPN client for macOS/Linus implementation in Go, powered by [fyne](https://github.com/fyne-io/fyne).

TODO:
- [ ] Maybe exclude VPN client into another sudo process worker and use IPC?
- [ ] Add logs tab with all std logs
- [x] Localization
- [ ] Refactor settings window mess.
- [ ] Update list without needing to reselect (fyne problem).
